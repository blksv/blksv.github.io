<p>The following are not hard and fast rules, but you have to have something really interesting to change my preferences

<h2><a href="/contract#_2">Compensation</a></h2>
<div class="meta">
</div>
<p>As of now, my <em>reference</em> hourly rate is 50 USD (if I haven't forgotten to update the page). I work max 100 hours per month, which is a physiological maximum for concentrated intellectual work unless you are either (a) a cheater, (b) heading for utter burnout, or (c) a space alien. I'm trying to maintain at least 30% of that time free for emergency situations and new projects. Except for urgent matters, the higher the rate you pay the higher the priority your project gets. Nothing personal, that's a free market.</p>
<p>The rate is <em>reference</em> because I don't engage in contracts like "I've bought your time, thus now it is for me to dispose" (effectively disguised employment). When you hand me a problem, it is for me to decide what I'm to do with it and at what price. If it is a well-defined problem, you'll usually get a fixed price tag. If not, we may decide on another compensation scheme.</p>
<p>As I'm a contractor, there are significant differences from typical employee's terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>I <em>don't</em> charge for background processing of your tasks, which may account for much more than 50% of total time spent (and thus payable to an employee; I hope you don't expect employees to work on your tasks out of their work hours, and also don't want them to work without thinking).</li>
<li>I <em>don't</em> charge for bugfixing, even after the code is shipped, and do it at the highest priority. But only if it is really my fault and not a result of some third-party misbehavior or <em>specification deficiency</em>. And this is the only responsibility I bear regarding my work.</li>
<li>I'm interested in saving you money by minimizing the development, support, and infrastructure expenses: you'd better pay 4000$/mo to me than 20000$ to a team of four (+ social taxes and the like) working with the same efficiency.</li>
<li>In the years of my work I've come by a stock of standard solutions to typical tasks (both backend and frontend), which makes the development process really fast. When I use these in your project it is <em>completely free of charge</em>.</li>
<li>You'll have <em>absolutely no means</em> to make me work on something I deem harmful or unnecessary for your project or its audience other than changing my mind on that subject.</li>
<li>You'll have <em>absolutely no means</em> to check the billed hours, nor any ways to control when and how I work on your tasks.</li>
<li>You <em>won't</em> have property rights on the results by default. See below for the guidelines on that.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, technical support, research, and similar work is billed per hour, with 1-hour granularity. Thus, it's much cheaper for you to arrange uninterrupted sessions rather than ask random questions now-and-then. Bug investigation is free of charge if it shows the bug to be my fault. Otherwise, it is billed as technical support at the current reference rate. I also offer fixed-price technical support packages at various discounts, depending on the specifics of your project. Typically, it's 50%; i.e. for current rate of 50$/hr you might pay 750$/mo covering the first 30 hours of technical support for each month the contract is active and paid.</p>

<p>Paying for a task being done <em>doesn't</em> automatically buys you property rights on the obtained results. The general rules are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>If I use some of my pre-developed solutions in your project, I give you an <em>unlimited free license</em> to use and modify these <em>in that project</em>. But I <em>retain property rights</em> to any generic (i.e. not specifically related to the domain you operate in) improvements I made to them in the course of adapting to your project.</li>
<li>If I come by a solution to some generic problem while working on your project, I <em>retain property rights</em> to that solution. You get an <em>unlimited free license</em> to do anything with this solution (modify and use in any of your projects, license, sublicense, sell, open-source, etc.).</li>
<li>If my work is mundane software development, you get a <em>sole license</em> to the results (it's almost as if you get the property rights, but give me an unlimited free license to use the results in (and only) my own projects). Me giving up the rights to use the results in my own projects may be subject to an additional royalty or property rights transfer agreement.</li>
<li>If my work contains some business-critical results (i.e. they enable your entire business or a part of it, or give it a significant competitive advantage), and there were no possible ways for you to achieve the same without my assistance with comparable time/money/other resources costs, then you'll <em>have to</em> sign additional royalty or property rights transfer agreement to use this results.</li>
<li>To prevent "digital waste" compounding, all the licenses are effective while you're in the business the licensed materials developed for, so my work won't turn out in vain just because you lost the interest and I lost the rights to employ it for the public good.</li>
</ol>

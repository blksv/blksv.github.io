<p>Constructive style requires a programmer to structure a project in some regular, uniform manner.
Like a building.
It is the only possible way of the large-scale programming, because it makes for easy onboarding, independence of individual developers, and thus high predictability of outcomes.
Its limit is the "append-only programming", where the project is pushed forward only by adding new (and sometimes deleting old) parts, without touching existing code.
SOLID is, effectively, the epitome of the append-only coding principles.</p>
<p>As mastering this style drives one's career to handsomely-paid positions in megacorps, it became de-facto standard in the industry.
For otherwise-minded companies are cut off developers and otherwise-minded developers are cut off their career.</p>
<p>But this is detrimental for the industry.</p>
<p>At the surface level, uniformity of the codebase means tons of boilerplate code.
A programmer is just not allowed to code straight to the point, but must fit the solution into the required structure.
This alone already creates bloated barely-moving overconsuming software.</p>
<p>A level deeper, it means tons of infrastructure code.
Piles of frameworks over frameworks to handle at least part of that boilerplate.
And then — hordes of adapters between the domain logic and all this frameworks.</p>
<p>Another level, and we arrive at the need of a very careful design.
For it is almost impossible to refactor such a system in a way the original design does not support, because it would mean rewriting almost all the boilerplate and infrastructure.</p>
<p>But to err is human.
And millions of developers are burning out fitting elegant solutions into uniform structures doomed to a soon massive rewrite.
And thousands of projects grind to a complete halt being overwhelmed by unessential code bloat.</p>
<p>That's why I advocate for organic style.
Which is, essentially, KISS, DRY and YAGNI, as opposed to SOLID, and aims for compact, straight to the point codebase, which  constantly evolves, and not just getting appended to.</p>
<p>But of course, this style is also a host of fatal deficiencies conspiring to kill your project.</p>
<ol>
<li>It doesn't scale. It admits no more than 3–5 closely communicating developers, which can work with the same productivity as maybe 10–20 in a constructive environment, but you just cannot have more, unless you can split the project into smaller ones with well-specified boundaries.</li>
<li>No juniors.
   Because a "straight to the point solution" is not "the first out of the head".
   The automatic following "the best practices" also goes to trash, as they are tailored to the constructive style.</li>
<li>It is much easier to end up with an untractable mess in the codebase.
   You have to plan for regular reviews and refactorings.
   A major event in the constructive style, refactoring becomes a permanent activity in the organic.</li>
<li>Still, the code could look like a mess.
   And there are much less developers ready to work in this style.</li>
</ol>
<p>Still, for a young (or simply a small-scale) project the organic style seems to me much more preferable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Organic small-scale is maybe an order (orders?) of magnitude larger than constructive small-scale in terms of functionality and user base.
   Because of compactness and efficiency of the codebase.</li>
<li>3 upper-mid developers are much more affordable than 1 architect, 1 teamlead, 3 mids and 5–10 juniors which are about the same output in the constructive style.</li>
<li>Compact codebase fosters common ownership, reduces project risks and simplifies onboarding. It also minimizes developers' burnout rate.</li>
</ol>
